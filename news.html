		<p>Real Madrid captain Ramos and Barcelona's Pique are 
Spain's long-standing centre-back partnership but have 
frequently clashed publically as proud performers on 
either side of El Clasico's divide.<p>
<p<>Sniping over refereeing decisions, with each believing the
other's side is the beneficiary of favourable 
treatment, has dominated their discourse 
over recent months. Despite this, Ramos pledged to 
give Pique a hug once Julen Lopetegui's squad came 
together for Friday's World Cup qualifier against 
Israel and Busquets reported a positive feel in the
camp.</p>
<p>"They are many years with the national team, Ramos 
and Pique and the atmosphere is good," he told El Partidazo.
"The good vibe is magnificent."Here, Sergio is the captain 
and has more hierarchy and, at Barca, Gerard has more of a 
leadership role."</p>

		<p>Barcelona star Neymar has affirmed he is loving his
partnership with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, while rumours 
of a transfer away from the club continue to circulate.</p>
<p>The South American MSN trio is one of the world's most potent
attacking units, driving Barcelona to two Liga titles and a
 Champions League in two seasons.And despite links to a blockbuster
 transfer to Manchester United, Neymar is only thinking about 
starring alongside his two distinguished team-mates.</p>
<p>"[Messi] is a guy who helped me a lot in those four years of 
Barcelona, especially at the beginning when I had a hard time," 
the Brazil star told reporters on Monday.</p> 
<p>"A guy who has I do not know how many Ballons d'Or, came to me
 and said, 'Calm down, play your own game.' I'm happy when he makes 
 a goal, or gives an assist.</p>

        <p>The 33-year-old has won 18 major trophies, including 
six Bundesliga titles and the Champions League, since moving to

<p>Ribery has now admitted that he was tempted when the likes of 
Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United and Juventus came calling,
 but credited president Uli Hoeness and Rummenigge for convincing him
 to stay.</p>
 <p>"Of course I thought about a move," he told  Kicker. "In 2008 or 2009,
 every big club wanted me: Juventus, Inter, Milan, Barca, Real, Chelsea,
 Manchester...</p>
 <p>"In hindsight,I have to thank Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinz

<p>Manchester United continue to edge ever so slightly closer to the Europa League
crown and the Champions League pass which comes with it after a 1-1 quarter-final 
first leg draw over Anderlecht on Thursday. And once more it was Henrikh Mkhitaryan 
who led them through an imposing fixture with a crucial  away goal.</p>
<p>While Leander Dendoncker's late equaliser took some of the shine off United's 
performance, Mkhitaryan's first-half effort ensured that Jose Mourinho's side 
head to Old Trafford next week in the box seat. What's more,the Armenian is fast
usurping Zlatan Ibrahimovic as the face of this European run.</p>
<p>Just as he did in the previous two away knockout games, Mkhitaryan grabbed 
the decisive goal in the first half. At Saint-Etienne he poked home a strike 
which killed the remaining  intrigue in the tie after United's 3-0 first-leg win,
while in Rostov it was his away goal that put the Red Devils at ease on an awful
pitch.</p>

<p>Diego Godin believes Jamie Vardy would get into the Atletico Madrid team
 as he prepares to face the Leicester striker in the Champions League.</p>
 <p>The Foxes frontman drew a blank against Atleti in Spain as the La Liga 
 outfit established a narrow 1-0 lead in their quarter-final encounter.</p>
 <p>Vardy will, however, be looking to make his presence felt in a return 
 date at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday, with Godin fully aware of the
 threat posed by the England international.</p>
 <p>Vardy has netted 13 times in all competitions this season, with only

<p>The talismanic duo are out of contract next summer and it's 
vital that the Gunners do all they can to keep them at the Emirates Stadium</p>
<p>It's been a while since Arsenal supporters have sung the infamous we have 
got Ozil' chant which was previously heard with much gusto at the start 
of the season.</p>
<p> The Germany international’s form has dipped since the turn of the year 
and against Middlesbrough he showed in spells why keeping him at the club 
is crucial in not only challenging for major honours - but equally attracting
 other marquee names to Emirates Stadium.</p>
